# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chrome Vertical Tab Bar is a modern, responsive vertical tab management application for Windows, built with Electron and TypeScript. It provides an advanced interface for organizing browser tabs in a vertical layout with features like drag-and-drop reordering, section-based organization, color coding, glass morphism effects, and intelligent responsive design that adapts to different window sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Tab Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage browser tabs in a vertical layout, so that I can better organize and access my open tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a vertical tab bar interface
2. WHEN a user adds a new tab THEN the system SHALL create a tab element with URL, title, and favicon
3. WHEN a user clicks on a tab THEN the system SHALL open the corresponding URL in the default browser
4. WHEN a user right-clicks on a tab THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with tab management options
5. WHEN a user removes a tab THEN the system SHALL delete the tab from the interface and update storage

### Requirement 2: Drag and Drop Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reorder tabs by dragging and dropping them, so that I can organize my tabs according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts dragging a tab THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with ghost and drag classes
2. WHEN a user drags a tab over another position THEN the system SHALL show drop target indicators
3. WHEN a user drops a tab in a new position THEN the system SHALL update the tab order and save the changes
4. WHEN a user drags a tab between sections THEN the system SHALL move the tab to the target section
5. WHEN dragging is cancelled (ESC key or window blur) THEN the system SHALL reset all drag states and visual feedback

### Requirement 3: Section-Based Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize tabs into named sections, so that I can group related tabs together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new section THEN the system SHALL add a section header with the specified name
2. WHEN a user moves a tab to a section THEN the system SHALL update the tab's section property
3. WHEN a user renames a section THEN the system SHALL update all tabs in that section
4. WHEN a user deletes an empty section THEN the system SHALL remove the section header
5. WHEN a section has no tabs THEN the system SHALL display it as an empty section with appropriate styling

### Requirement 4: Color Coding System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to assign colors to sections, so that I can visually distinguish between different groups of tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the color picker icon THEN the system SHALL display available color options horizontally
2. WHEN a user selects a color for a section THEN the system SHALL apply the color to the section header background
3. WHEN a user selects "No Color" THEN the system SHALL remove any applied color from the section
4. WHEN a section has a color applied THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable with appropriate contrast
5. WHEN colors are changed THEN the system SHALL persist the color settings in local storage

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design and Window Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to adapt to different window sizes, so that I can use the application efficiently in various screen configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the window width is 140px or less THEN the system SHALL switch to narrow mode with hamburger menus
2. WHEN the window width is greater than 140px THEN the system SHALL display full-featured layout with all options visible
3. WHEN a user resizes the window by dragging the right edge THEN the system SHALL update the width within bounds (90px - 300px)
4. WHEN the window is resized THEN the system SHALL update window control button sizes appropriately
5. WHEN in narrow mode THEN the system SHALL compress window controls to maximize space (42px â†’ 32px total width)

### Requirement 6: Advanced UI and Visual Effects

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern interface with glass morphism effects and smooth animations, so that I have an aesthetically pleasing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying popup menus THEN the system SHALL apply glass morphism effects with backdrop blur
2. WHEN transitioning between states THEN the system SHALL use 0.3s smooth animations
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
4. WHEN expanding color pickers THEN the system SHALL animate the expansion horizontally to the right
5. WHEN applying themes THEN the system SHALL ensure perfect dark/light mode compatibility

### Requirement 7: System Integration and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to integrate with the Windows system and remember my settings, so that I can have a seamless experience across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL restore previously saved tabs, sections, and window position
2. WHEN minimizing the application THEN the system SHALL provide system tray integration
3. WHEN the application is closed THEN the system SHALL save all current state to local storage
4. WHEN launching silently THEN the system SHALL start without showing command windows
5. WHEN configured for auto-start THEN the system SHALL launch automatically on Windows startup

### Requirement 8: Context Menus and User Interactions

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive context menus and interaction options, so that I can efficiently manage tabs and sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN right-clicking on a tab THEN the system SHALL show options to move to sections or remove the tab
2. WHEN right-clicking on empty space THEN the system SHALL show options to create new sections or add tabs
3. WHEN clicking section hamburger menus THEN the system SHALL show section management options
4. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I) THEN the system SHALL open developer tools
5. WHEN interacting with system tray THEN the system SHALL provide show/hide and management options

### Requirement 9: Favicon and Visual Representation

**User Story:** As a user, I want tabs to display accurate favicons and visual representations, so that I can quickly identify different websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new tab THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch the actual website favicon
2. WHEN favicon extraction fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback favicon services
3. WHEN validating favicons THEN the system SHALL ensure images are properly sized and valid
4. WHEN displaying tabs THEN the system SHALL show favicon, title, and URL information clearly
5. WHEN favicons are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use appropriate fallback representations

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Robustness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I don't lose my work or experience crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL continue operating with fallback options
2. WHEN drag operations are interrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to a clean state
3. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt recovery
4. WHEN invalid URLs are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and provide user feedback
5. WHEN the application encounters unexpected states THEN the system SHALL force reset to prevent stuck states
